This repository holds some of the work I've completed throughout my academic studies in Computer Science. 

The Paint Project was intended to replicate the basic functionality of
Microsoft Paint, utlizing a Java Applet framework. 

There are 4 files:
Circle.java - Defines the circle objects utilized to form a point
PaintWindow.java - Creates the Java Applet window that contains the other aspects of the Paint program, including the size and color selectors
DrawPad.java - Encompasses the actual draw pad in which the user utilizes to draw individual circles or continuous lines of circles

Paint.jar should work to combine all 4 files into a runnable file within a Java Development Environment
